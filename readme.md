# About

This is a small little project that I built to scratch my own itch.

I've been working with Wordpress, and I finally got tired of filling a page with lorem ipsum,
and then copying something else, and having to run over to lorem ipsum to cut again.

This way it's right at my side whenever I need it.

It's a small project, but probably one of my favorite things I've ever made.

#How to Use

Download it, go to chrome://extensions, click "developer mode", and then click "Load unpacked extension...". That's all!

#Development

If you think you can make some improvements to it, please feel free! I'd love for anyone to make an improvement on my little ole' app.
